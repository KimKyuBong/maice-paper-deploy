Note. Score ranges from 1 (I completely agree) to 5 (I do not agree at all), n=36 (ST) & 29 (nST). Questions: To
what extent do you agree with the following statement? (1) The use of AI chatbots contradicts the purpose of
education. (2) I am concerned about how AI chatbots will affect student learning in the future. (3) I am concerned
about how the use of the chatbot could negatively affect my learning process. (4) I am worried that my own
performance becomes less meaningful due to the use of AI. Underlying values reflect raw item means; inferential
results were obtained via multi-level modelling using R (R version 4.3.0, library(lme4), Linear mixed model fit by
REML ['lmerMod'], random intercepts by participant, 65 students, 122 observations. Standardised coefficients
calculated using Satterthwaite's method ['lmerModLmerTest'].
On the other hand, as universities have long functioned not merely as venues for
knowledge transmission but as spaces for cultivating human connection and community
building (Brouwer et al., 2016; Pittman & Richmond, 2008), the shift toward AI-mediated
learning necessitates a conscious reaffirmation 21st century competences such as collaboration,
communication and creativity as summarised by Voogt & Roblin (2012). Dialogic engagement,
collaborative learning, and informal peer interaction, hallmarks of the university experience,
must be preserved and reimagined within MAS ecologies. Interacting with AI agents should
not displace, but rather scaffold and extend, the meaningful dialogue between learners.
In sum, we expect the introduction of orchestrated MAS in higher education to not only
augment instructional capacity but reconfigure what it means to be a competent learner. Future-
ready students must be able to collaborate with, reflect on, and critique AI systems while
cultivating their own creativity and social reasoning. Multi-agent environments therefore
provide both a challenge and an opportunity: they invite new forms of interaction that stretch
traditional notions of competence but require equally new pedagogical commitments to ensure
these interactions remain equitable and educationally meaningful.
9. Cost-Effectiveness and Scalability Considerations
The average cost per student interaction with the Socratic AI chatbot during the
experiment was approximately $0.0057 for a five-minute session, resulting in a total
expenditure of $0.25 across all participants. These figures reflect token-based pricing and are
subject to variation depending on the length and complexity of individual prompts and
responses. Given equivalent token-based pricing, the Socratic AI tutor proved more cost-
effective than the non-Socratic variant. In light of recent evidence that online tutoring can
generate significant learning gains (Carlana & La Ferrara, 2024), our findings highlight the
promise of dialogic, AI-mediated scaffolding. Socratic AI tutors may offer a scalable and cost-
efficient alternative that aligns with pedagogical goals traditionally associated with human
tutoring.
Additionally, for comparative purposes, we estimated the cost of an equivalent human-
led tutorial interaction using a conservative calculation based on the hourly rate of a research
associate in the German higher education context. Excluding ancillary employment costs (e.g.
social security contributions), and assuming a gross salary-based hourly rate (pay scale TV-L
2025, E13,3), a five-minute exchange per student would amount to approximately €2.72.
Multiplied across 44 students, this results in an estimated total of €119.684 for a given HEI
replicating this experiment with humans.

10. Conclusion: A New Learning Infrastructure for Higher Education
This paper set out to move beyond dominant automation narratives by reframing
generative AI not as a tool for cognitive offloading, but as a dialogic infrastructure capable of
augmenting epistemic agency. Drawing on constructivist theory and the Socratic method, we
presented an AI chatbot prototype designed to support students in the formulation of research
questions through structured questioning. Empirical findings from our controlled experiment
underscore that such dialogic AI systems can meaningfully stimulate reflective, critical and
independent thinking.
While this experiment serves as feasibility assessment and provide evidence in favour
of dialog infrastructure, the significance of this intervention lies not in the standalone
performance of the Socratic Tutor itself, but in its role as a proof of concept for one
agent within a larger, orchestrated multi-agent systems. Orchestrated MAS offer a broader
architectural vision in which specialised agents, such as Socratic guides, critical companions,
and affective coaches, work in tandem, under pedagogical orchestration, to support diverse
learner needs and trajectories. Unlike monolithic AI deployments, MAS are designed to be
modular, work with the same knowledge, be pedagogically aligned, and epistemically diverse.
From this perspective, orchestrated MAS constitute a new learning infrastructure: a
hybrid approach in which human and artificial agents collaboratively engage in sustained,
reflective inquiry. This shift redefines educational roles. Educators become orchestrators of
learning processes, curating agent constellations in line with instructional intent. Students
become epistemic co-agents, responsible for navigating, evaluating, and synthesising input
from a distributed field of human and non-human educators.
To realise this vision, four institutional commitments are essential. First, a pedagogical
commitment to epistemic empowerment: AI systems must scaffold inquiry and foster agency,
not automate cognition. Second, a technical and infrastructural commitment. We hope future
multi-agent ecosystems to be developed as modular, extensible, and non-proprietary. Third,
an ethical commitment to transparency, contestability, and human-centred design: orchestration
layers must enable human oversight and value-sensitive alignment. And fourth, a commitment
to overhaul curricula reflecting the changing educational landscape.
As generative systems become embedded in the everyday experience of learning,
universities must foster not only AI literacy, but the human literacies that allow learners to
thrive in hybrid epistemic communities. At their best, multi-agent systems enable new
constellations of support, scalable, dialogic, and equitable. But their promise will only be
fulfilled through intentional pedagogical design and sustained institutional commitments.
