# Hattie & Timperley (2007) - The Power of Feedback
## 핵심 원문 발췌

### ✅ 효과크기 0.79 (페이지 3)

> "At least 12 previous meta-analyses have included specific information on feedback in classrooms (Table 1). These meta-analyses included 196 studies and 6,972 effect sizes. **The average effect size was 0.79** (twice the average effect). To place this average of 0.79 into perspective, it fell in the top 5 to 10 highest influences on achievement in Hattie's (1999) synthesis, along with direct instruction (0.93), reciprocal teaching (0.86), students' prior cognitive ability (0.71)..."

**검증**: ✅ 본 논문 2장 2.4.1에서 "d=0.79"로 정확히 인용됨

### ✅ 힌지포인트 0.40 (페이지 3)

> "Hattie (1999) reported a synthesis of over 500 meta-analyses, involving 450,000 effect sizes from 180,000 studies, representing approximately 20 to 30 million students, on various influences on student achievement... **The average or typical effect of schooling was 0.40 (SE = 0.05)**, and this provided a benchmark figure or 'standard' from which to judge the various influences on achievement, such as that of feedback."

**검증**: ✅ 2007 논문에서도 0.40 언급 → 2009 책에서 "힌지포인트" 개념으로 발전

### ✅ 3가지 피드백 질문 (페이지 6-7, Figure 1)

> "Effective feedback must answer three major questions asked by a teacher and/or by a student: **Where am I going?** (What are the goals?), **How am I going?** (What progress is being made toward the goal?), and **Where to next?** (What activities need to be undertaken to make better progress?) These questions correspond to notions of **feed up, feed back, and feed forward**."

**검증**: ✅ 본 논문에서 직접 인용하지 않았지만, 2장 2.4 피드백 설계 원리의 이론적 기반

### ✅ 4가지 피드백 레벨 (페이지 6, 10)

**페이지 6:**
> "How effectively answers to these questions serve to reduce the gap is partly dependent on **the level at which the feedback operates**. These include the level of **task performance**, the level of **process** of understanding how to do a task, the **regulatory or metacognitive process** level, and/or the **self or personal level** (unrelated to the specifics of the task). Feedback has differing effects across these levels."

**페이지 10:**
> "Thus, there is a distinction between **feedback about the task (FT)**, about the **processing of the task (FP)**, about **self-regulation (FR)**, and about the **self as a person (FS)**. We argue that **FS is the least effective**, FR and FP are powerful in terms of deep processing and mastery of tasks, and FT is powerful when the task information subsequently is useful for improving strategy processing or enhancing self-regulation."

**4가지 레벨**:
1. **FT (Task)**: 과제 수준
2. **FP (Process)**: 과정 수준
3. **FR (Self-Regulation)**: 자기조절 수준
4. **FS (Self)**: 자아 수준 (가장 비효과적)

**검증**: ✅ 본 논문 2.4.1의 "4가지 핵심 요소"는 이 모델을 간소화한 것

### ✅ Feed Up, Feed Back, Feed Forward (페이지 8)

> "Effective teaching not only involves imparting information and understandings to students... but also involves assessing and evaluating students' understanding of this information, so that the next teaching act can be matched to the present understanding of the students. This 'second part' is the feedback part, and it relates to the **three major questions** identified in Figure 1: **Where am I going? How am I going? and Where to next?** These three questions address the dimensions of **feed up, feed back, and feed forward**."

**검증**: ✅ Hattie (2009) 9장(9920-9947줄)에서도 동일 모델 제시

---

### ✅ 피드백의 목적 (페이지 6)

> "The claim is made that the **main purpose of feedback is to reduce discrepancies between current understandings and performance and a goal**. Strategies students and teachers use to reduce this discrepancy may be more or less effective in enhancing learning..."

**검증**: ✅ 본 논문 2.4.1의 피드백 정의와 일치
