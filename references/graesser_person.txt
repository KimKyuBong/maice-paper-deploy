Question Asking During Tutoring

Whereas it is well documented that student question asking is infrequent in
classroom environments, there is little research on questioning processes during tutoring. The present study investigated the questions asked in tutoring
sessions on research methods (college students) and algebra (7th graders). Student questions were approximately 240 times as frequent in tutoring settings
as classroom settings, whereas tutor questions were only slightly more frequent
than teacher questions. Questions were classified by (a) degree of specification, (b) content, and (c) question-generation mechanism to analyze their quality. Student achievement was positively correlated with the quality of student
questions after students had some experience with tutoring, but the frequency
of questions was not correlated with achievement. Students partially selfregulated their learning by identifying knowledge deficits and asking questions
to repair them, but they need training to improve these skills. We identified
some ways that tutors and teachers might improve their question-asking skills.

Question Asking During Tutoring
Q uestion asking has had a controversial status in education. At one extreme,
some researchers believe that question asking (and answering) are very
central components in theories of learning, cognition, and education. Ideal
students presumably are capable of actively self-regulating their learning by being
sensitive to their own knowledge deficits and by seeking information that repairs
such deficits. Researchers in education and developmental psychology have frequently advocated educational settings that engage students in active learning
and problem solving, or that directly train self-regulatory learning strategies in
students (Bransford, Arbitman-Smith, Stein, & Vye, 1985; Collins, 1985, 1988;
Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Papert, 1980; Piaget, 1952; Pressley & Levin, 1983;
Pressley, Goodchild, Fleet, Zajchowski, & Evans, 1989; Zimmerman, 1989). According to a number of models in cognitive science, question generation is a
fundamental component in cognitive processes that operate at deep conceptual levels, such as the comprehension of text and social action (Collins, Brown,
& Larkin, 1980; Hilton, 1990; Olson, Duffy, & Mack, 1985), the learning of complex material (Collins, 1985; Miyake & Norman, 1979: Palincsar & Brown, 1984;
Schank, 1986), problem solving (Reisbeck, 1988), and creativity (Sternberg,
1987). There also is empirical evidence that improvements in the comprehension, learning, and memory of technical material can be achieved by training
students to ask good questions (Davey & McBride, 1986; Gavelek & Raphael,
1985; King, 1989, 1990; Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Singer & Donlan, 1982).
At the other extreme, however, there are researchers who have reconciled
themselves to the fact that student questions do not play a central role in the
normal process of learning (Dillon, 1988). It is well documented that student
questions in the classroom are very infrequent and unsophisticated. The
estimated frequencies of student questions per hour have ranged from 1.3 to
4.0, with a median of 3.0, in available classroom studies (Buseri, 1988; Dillon,
1988; Fenclova, 1978; Good, Slavings, Harel, & Emerson, 1987; Nickel & Fenner, 1974; Susskind, 1969). These classroom studies have spanned several countries (including Germany, the United States, Nigeria, and Czechoslovakia), so
the low frequency of student questions appears to be a universal phenomenon.
Given that an average class has approximately 26.7 students (see Dillon, 1988),
the frequency of questions generated by a particular student within an hour
is only .11 question (i.e., 3 + 26.7). In contrast to the student questions, the
frequency of teacher questions is quite high, ranging from 30 to 120 questions
per hour, with a mean of 69 questions. Therefore, 96% of the questions in
a classroom environment are teacher questions. In addition to being infrequent,
student questions are also unsophisticated (Dillon, 1988; Flammer, 1981; Kerry,
1987). That is, they are normally shallow, short-answer questions that address
the content and interpretation of explicit material; they are rarely high-level
questions that involve inferences, multistep reasoning, the application of an idea
to a new domain of knowledge, the synthesis of a new idea from multiple information sources, or the critical evaluation of a claim.
The low frequency and sophistication of student questions can be attributed
to barriers at three different levels. One barrier is that students have difficulty
identifying their own knowledge deficits (Baker, 1979; Glenberg, Wilkinson,
105 
Graesser and Person
& Epstein, 1982; Graesser & McMahen, 1993; Markman, 1979; Pressley, Ghatala,
Woloshyn, & Pirie, 1990), unless they have high amounts of domain knowledge
(Brown, Bransford, Ferrara, & Campione, 1983; Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reiman,
& Glaser, 1989; Miyake & Norman, 1979). Students have difficulty detecting
contradictory information, in identifying missing data that are necessary for a
solution, and in discriminating superfluous from necessary information. A second barrier to question asking involves social editing (Graesser, McMahen, &
Johnson, in press; van der Meij, 1987, 1988). The student reveals ignorance
and loses status when a bad question is asked. There are social barriers even
when a good question is asked, such as interrupting the teacher and changing
the topic of conversation. A third barrier lies in a deficit in acquiring good
question-asking skills. Most teachers are not excellent role models for asking
good questions. A small percentage of teacher questions (4%) are high-level
questions; most of their questions are short-answer questions that grill the
students on explicit material (Kerry, 1987; Dillon, 1988). Few teachers adopt
sophisticated Socratic methods in which the teacher constructs sequences of
thought-provoking questions that expose the student's misconceptions and contradictions (Collins, 1985; Stevens, Collins, & Goldin, 1982). Given that several
students are in a classroom, it would be impractical for a teacher to diagnose
and repair the knowledge deficits of several particular students. For whatever
reason, the low frequency and quality of student questions in a classroom constitute a challenge for educational theories and philosophies that emphasize active self-regulated learning.
It is conceivable that one-to-one tutoring environments might remove many
of the barriers that prevent students from asking questions in a classroom. First,
tutoring sessions are allegedly tailored to the knowledge deficits of a particular
student. The tutor therefore has a sustained opportunity to identify and query
such deficits. Second, many of the social barriers to asking questions are removed in a one-to-one tutoring session because there is a dialogue between
only two individuals (i.e., tutor and student). The student may be embarrassed
in front of his of her peers when a question reflects ignorance in a classroom
setting, whereas pressure from peers is minimized in one-to-one tutoring. It
is appropriate for the student to interrupt the tutor with questions and to change
the topic of conversation in a student-centered exchange. Third, students might
become exposed to better questions in a tutoring environment because the
tutors have the opportunity to concentrate on deeper levels of understanding
and reasoning. The present investigation of question asking was inspired by
the possibility that tutoring environments hold some promise in facilitating question asking and active learning.
Surprisingly, few studies have investigated the process and educational
benefits of tutoring. It is reasonably well documented that learning of
mathematics and readings skills is better in one-to-one tutoring sessions than
in classroom settings (Bloom, 1984; Cohen, Kulik, & Kulik, 1982). According
to Cohen et al.'s (1982) meta-analysis of 52 tutoring studies, tutoring raised the
performance of students by .4 standard deviation units compared to a conventional classroom control. It is informative to note that the impact of tutoring
106 
Question Asking During Tutoring
on learning was not significantly related to the amount of tutoring training that
the tutors had received or to age differences between tutor and student, but
it was higher for structured than unstructured tutoring programs (see also FitzGibbon, 1977). Tutoring is sometimes successful when tutors are peers of students rather than topic experts (Cohen et al., 1982; Rogoff, 1990). Perhaps tutors
need to be exceptionally well trained in the tutoring process and in the domain
knowledge before such expertise yields high payoffs in student learning. It
should be noted, however, that most tutors in a school system consist of students, paraprofessionals, and adult volunteers rather than highly skilled tutors.
It is presently unclear why there is such an advantage of tutoring over classroom settings because of the lack of research on the process of tutoring (see
Graesser, 1993, in press; McArthur, Stasz, & Zmuidzinas, 1990; Putnam, 1987).
However, several hypotheses would account for the advantage. According to
an active inquiry hypothesis, students perhaps ask more questions in tutoring
sessions and thereby correct their own idiosyncratic knowledge deficits: Better learning would result from the inquiry and monitoring of knowledge deficits.
According to an explanation hypothesis, tutoring may make explicit some important patterns of reasoning and problem solving that the classroom setting
cannot readily furnish because of time and resource limitations. Explanations
are provided by the tutor, by the student, or by a collaboration between tutor
and student. Learning is facilitated to the extent that there are explanations of
facts and events conveyed in the material to be learned (Anderson, Conrad,
& Corbett, 1989; Chi et al., 1989; Pressley, Symons, McDaniel, Snyder, & Turnure, 1988). Much of the reasoning and problem solving is exposed when deeplevel questions are asked and answered (i.e., why, why not, how, what if).
Perhaps explanatory reasoning and these deep-level questions are more prevalent
in tutoring sessions and can account for the benefits from tutoring. According
to a questioning-skill hypothesis, tutors may ask better questions in a tutoring
setting than in a classroom, and these questioning skills may be learned by the
student during the course of tutoring. As discussed earlier, there is ample evidence that learning improves to the extent that students learn how to ask good
questions. According to a diagnosis and remediation hypothesis, tutoring provides more opportunities than classroom interactions for individual students
to reveal their faulty thinking or misconceptions, and for the tutor to tailor subsequent instruction to the idiosyncratic needs of a particular student (van Lehn,
1990). Some potential explanations of the advantages of tutoring are unrelated
to questioning per se. For example, perhaps students are merely more engaged
with the material, for longer time spans, in tutoring environments. Although
we acknowledge the potential importance of these other variables, the present
study focuses on the role of questions in the tutoring process.
Given the lack of research on the tutoring process, the present study investigated the frequency and quality of questions that tutors and students ask
during tutoring sessions. Transcripts of tutoring sessions were collected from
college students in a scientific research methods class and from seventh graders
having difficulties in algebra. Our analyses of questions focused on three specific
objectives. The first objective was to document the frequency of questions dur107 
Graesser and Person
ing tutoring and to compare these frequencies to those in classroom settings.
The second objective was to analyze the qualitative characteristics of questions
in the corpus, as will be discussed shortly. The third objective was to examine
the extent to which the students' achievement in the research methods course
was correlated with the frequency and qualitative characteristics of the student
questions. It should be noted that it was well beyond the scope of this study
to assess whether particular characteristics of the questioning process have a
causal relationship with learning outcomes.
Theoretical Schemes for Analyzing Questions
Schemes for analyzing the qualitative characteristics of questions have been proposed by researchers in education (Dillon, 1984, 1988; Flammer, 1981; van der
Meij, 1987), psychology (Clark & Schaefer, 1989; Graesser, Langston, & Baggett, in press; Graesser, Person, & Huber, 1992), computational linguistics
(Dalhgren, 1988; Gordon & Lakoff, 1972), and artificial intelligence (Allen, 1983;
Kaplan, 1983; Lehnert, 1978; Schank, 1986; Webber, 1988). The present study
adopted an analytical scheme developed by Graesser et al. (1992). The GraesserPerson-Huber (GPH) scheme was influenced both by the theoretical work in
these fields and by preliminary empirical analyses of tutoring data. According
to the GPH scheme, a question is analyzed on three dimensions: the content
of the information requested, the psychological mechanism that generates a
question (a dimension that considers the context of the question), and degree
of specification. Aside from these theoretical analyses of question quality, there
are some preliminary issues about questions that must be addressed: the contrast between presupposition and focus, the assumptions behind informationseeking questions, and an analysis of what constitutes a question. These issues
and qualitative dimensions are briefly summarized in this section. More extensive discussions are available in other reports (Graesser, 1993; Graesser et al.,
in press; Graesser, Person et al., 1992).
Preliminary Theoretical Analyses of Questions
Presupposition and focus. A question can be decomposed into presupposed information and the focal information being queried. For example, in
the question "What is the appropriate statistic to perform in the experiment?"
there are at least two presuppositions (i.e., there was an experiment, someone
performs an appropriate statistic) whereas the focus of the inquiry is on the
type of statistic. The presupposed information in a discourse segment is in the
common ground shared by the speaker and listener (Clark & Schaeffer, 1989).
The focus of the question draws the answerer's attention to information that
the questioner needs and hopes the answerer will supply.
Assumptions behind information-seeking questions. Speech act categories
are normally defined according to the assumptions shared by speech participants
rather than by syntactic or semantic regularities alone (Allen, 1983; Gibbs &
Mueller, 1988; Searle, 1969). When a genuine information-seeking question is
asked, the questioner is missing information and believes the answerer can supply it. Van der Meij (1987) identified several assumptions that must be met before
108 
Question Asking During Tutoring
an utterance constitutes a genuine information-seeking question: (a) the questioner does not know the information asked for in the question, (b) the questioner believes that the presuppositions of the question are true, (c) the
questioner believes that an answer exists, (d) the questioner wants to know
the answer, (e) the questioner can assess whether a reply constitutes an answer,
(f) the questioner believes that the answerer knows the answer, (g) the questioner believes that the answerer will not give an answer in absence of the question, (h) the questioner believes the answerer will supply the answer, (i) the
questioner believes that the benefits of asking the question exceed the costs.
A question fails to be an information-seeking question to the extent that these
assumptions are violated. For example, some interrogative utterances are indirect requests for the listener to do something on behalf of the speaker, as
in "Could you finish the session in the next five minutes?" (Clark, 1979; Gibbs
& Mueller, 1988; Gordon & Lakoff, 1972). Teacher questions are usually not
information-seeking questions because they violate assumptions a, d, f, and h.
Most student questions are information-seeking questions, although it is important to acknowledge that student questions may reflect auxiliary motives, that
is, to impress the teacher by asking a sophisticated question, to pass the burden
of conversation onto the tutor. A speech act is a bona fide inquiry to the extent that all of the nine previously mentioned assumptions are met.
What is a question? There is the pressing issue of what constitutes a question, given that questions cannot be defined according to syntactic or semantic criteria alone. For the purposes of this article, a question is defined as a speech
act that is either an inquiry (as defined previously), an interrogative expression,
that is, an utterance that would be followed by a question mark in print, or
both. The following expressions are inquiries, but only the first is an interrogative expression: "What is a factorial design?" (interrogative mood), "Tell
me what a factorial design is" (imperative mood), and "I need to know what
a factorial design is" (declarative mood). All of the following expressions are
in the interrogative mood, but only the first is an inquiry: "What is a factorial
design?" (inquiry), "Could you stop the session in 5 minutes?" (indirect request),
and "Why did I ever take this course?" (gripe). Therefore, there is not a simple
mapping between the syntactic mood of an utterance and its pragmatic speech
act category. In an effort to be inclusive in our analysis of questions, all of these
types of expressions would be counted as questions.
Theoretical Dimensions That Address Question Quality
Content of information sought. Table 1 presents the 18 question-content
categories in the GPH scheme (Graesser, Person et al., 1992). These categories
are defined according to the content of the information sought rather than on
the question stems (i.e., why, how, where, etc.) For example, antecedent questions tap previous events and states that cause or enable an event to occur.
Antecedent questions can be articulated linguistically with a variety of stems:
"Why did the event occur?" "How did the event occur?" "What caused the
event to occur?" and so on. Most of the questions have an interrogative syntactic form.

The question-content categories vary in the length of the expected answers.
Questions that invite short answers place few demands on the answerer because
a satisfactory answer is only a word or phrase. For example, acceptable answers
to a verification question are "Yes," "No," or "Maybe." Answers to long-answer
questions typically involve several sentences. One way to stimulate a listener
to talk is to ask long-answer questions. One might expect a good tutor to ask
many long-answer questions to diagnose the students' patterns of reasoning,
misconceptions, and amount of knowledge. An evasive student might ask the
tutor long-answer questions to shift the burden of conversation onto the tutor.
Reasoning is at the heart of the answers in some question-content categories.
In logical reasoning, the statements expressed in an answer consist of premises
and conclusions in a logical syllogism. In causal reasoning, the answer conveys
events and states in causal chains. In goal-oriented reasoning, the answer traces
the goals and planning structure of agents. Some of the analyses in this study
focus on deep-reasoning questions, which elicit patterns of reasoning in logical,
causal, or goal-oriented systems. Such questions include the following categories
in Table 1: antecedent, consequence, goal-orientation, instrumental/procedural,
enablement, and expectational. These questions are manifested in a tutoring
session to the extent that the tutor and student explore deeper levels of comprehension. These deep-reasoning questions are highly correlated with the deeper levels of cognition in Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives in the
cognitive domain (Bloom, 1956). Good students and tutors are expected to ask
these deep-reasoning questions.
Some questions are hybrids of two or more question categories. For example, verification questions are frequently combined with another category.
The question "Did the drug dosage decrease the anxiety?" is an amalgamation
of a verification question and an antecedent question. The fact that there are
hybrid questions should not be construed as a weakness in the classification
scheme. Most of the adequate classification schemes in the social sciences are
polythetic rather than monothetic (Stokal, 1974). Each observation can be assigned to one and only one category in a monothetic classification scheme,
whereas an observation can be assigned to multiple categories in a polythetic
classification.
Question-generation mechanisms. The GPH scheme specifies four major
mechanisms that generate questions in naturalistic conversation (including tutorial dialogue). Each major mechanism is segregated into subtypes, but these
subtypes will not be contrasted in this article. An analysis of question-generation
mechanisms incorporates the discourse context of a question. Judges must carefully analyze the goals, plans, and knowledge of the speech participants when
identifying the mechanisms that elicit or motivate a question. Moreover, these
question-generation mechanisms should be construed as being orthogonal to
the category scheme in Table 1. For example, a verification question could in
principle be motivated by any of the four major question-generation mechanisms.
The first major question-generation mechanism consists of informationseeking questions that occur when the questioner detects a knowledge deficit
in his or her own knowledge base. These occur under the following condi112 
Question Asking During Tutoring
tions: (a) when the questioner encounters an obstacle in a plan or problem,
(b) when the questioner encounters a contradiction, (c) when an unusual or
anomalous event is observed, (d) when there is an obvious gap in the questioner's knowledge base, and (e) when the questioner needs to make a decision among a set of alternatives that are equally likely. Good students presumably
ask these knowledge-deficit questions to the extent that they are capable of
self-regulating their knowledge.
The example knowledge-deficit question that follows (in italics) was extracted from a tutoring session on factorial designs in a college research methods
course.
Tutor: Cells are also the same thing as groups or called experimental
conditions. So those little boxes could be called cells, they
could be called groups, they could be called experimental
conditions.
Student: Wait a minute. When you say "boxes" what do you mean?
This student has a gap in her knowledge base about "boxes," so she asks the
tutor to clarify the meaning of that term. Regarding the question-content categories in Table 1, this would be a definitional question; regarding the classification of questions on question-generation mechanisms, the question would be
considered a knowledge-deficit question (and also a common-ground question).
The following example was also extracted from a tutoring session on factorial
designs.
Tutor: Is there a main effect for "A"?
Student: I don't think so.
Tutor: You don't think so?
Student: (Laughs.) Is there one?
This student spotted a contradiction between his own belief that there was no
main effect of A and the tutor's expressed doubt or uncertainty about the main
effect. The student asked the question to resolve the apparent contradiction.
The question would be classified in the knowledge-deficit category with respect
to question-generation mechanism; regarding its question-content category, the
question would be a hybrid between a verification and an interpretational
question.
The second major question-generation mechanism monitors the common
ground between speech participants. The speech participants need to establish,
negotiate, and update their mutual knowledge to achieve successful communication (Clark & Schaefer, 1989). Questions are generated to inquire whether the
listener knows anything about a topic (e.g., "Have you covered factorial designs?"), to verify that a belief is correct (e.g., "Doesn't a factorial design have
two independent variables?"), and to gauge how well a listener is understanding (e.g., "Do you understand?"). A good tutor should be able to identify the
common ground between tutor and student and to expand the student's knowledge at the fringe or frontier (Brown & Burton, 1978).
113 
Graesser and Person
The following excerpt was extracted from a tutoring session on variables
in a research methods course.
Tutor: Suppose I am studying the effects of dehydration on the
exploratory behavior of rats. One rat has had 23 hours of deprivation while another has had 30. What is the variable in
that situation? What are some of the variables?
Student: Did you say dehydration?
The student asked this "counterclarification" question to confirm that the tutor
had used a particular term (dehydration). Explicit utterances are supposed to
be automatically included in the common ground of speech participants (Clark
& Schaefer, 1989), so it is important that a listener registers what is said.
Sometimes common-ground questions address inferences or intended meanings rather than explicit information, as illustrated in the following.
The following excerpt was extracted from a tutoring session on interactions in factorial designs.
Tutor: Go ahead and put that one up on the board. I'll go ahead and
give you the numbers.
Student: Just the graph?
The subtypes of common-ground questions are quite different for students
and tutors. Students frequently want to confirm that their own beliefs are correct, so they ask common-ground questions that get the tutor to confirm or
disconfirm such beliefs (e.g., Doesn't the dependent variable go on the vertical
axis?). In contrast, tutors frequently ask common-ground questions that assess
what the student knows. For example, when the tutor asks the student "Do
you know what an antagonistic interaction is?", the tutor already knows the
answer and is assessing the student's amount of knowledge about the topic.
This is a common-ground question rather than a knowledge-deficit question.
Tutors frequently ask common-ground questions that inquire whether the student is understanding the material at a global level (e.g., "Do you understand?"
"Are you following?").
The third major question-generation mechanism coordinates social actions
among speech participants. These questions are needed for multiple agents to
collaborate in group activities and for single agents to get other agents to do
things. These questions include indirect requests (e.g., "Would you do X?"),
indirect advice ("Why don't you do X?"), permission ("Can I do X?"), offers
("Can I do X for you?"), and negotiations ("If I do X, will you do Y?"). Tutors
sometimes ask these social-coordination questions to engage students in activities that have pedagogical significance (e.g., "Could you graph these data
on the board?", "Why don't you compute that test?").
The fourth question-generation mechanism includes questions that are
asked to control the flow of conversation and the attention of speech participants. These conversation-control questions include greetings, gripes, replies
114 
Question Asking During Tutoring
to summons, rhetorical questions, and questions that change the flow of conversation. These questions were quite rare in the tutoring sessions.
Degree of specification. Questions vary on the degree to which the linguistic
content specifies the information being sought. Questions with high specification have words or phrases that refer to the elements of the desired information
and the relevant presupposed information. Questions with low specification
have few words and phrases, so a dialogue context is needed for the answerer
to fill in the missing information. A question is misinterpreted when the question has low specification and the answerer does not understand the dialogue
context. An example high-specification question is "What are the variables in
the factorial design in Experiment 1?"; the same question could be expressed
as a low-specification question, for example, "What are those?" A good tutor
should pose questions that have a sufficiently high specification for the student
to understand them.
Tutoring Sessions Investigated in This Study
The questions in two samples of tutoring sessions were analyzed in this study.
Both the frequency and the qualitative characteristics of the questions were
examined, using the theoretical scheme of Graesser, Person et al. (1992).
Although analyses were conducted on both the tutor questions and the student questions, we were particularly interested in the student questions because
they reflect active learning and they address the concern articulated earlier that
student questions in a classroom are both infrequent and unsophisticated.
The primary sample of tutoring sessions consisted of upper-division college
students in a research methods course. The tutoring sessions covered difficult
topics in the research methods course, particularly those that involve quantitative
reasoning. The tutoring sessions were a course requirement and counted as 6%
of the final grade. The tutors were graduate students who had received As in
a graduate-level research methods course. These tutors were not research
assistants in the course and were not aware of the research that was being conducted on the tutoring sessions.
There are several considerations that motivated our selection of this tutoring sample. First, we desired a tutoring situation in which tutoring is known
to be comparatively effective. According to available studies of tutoring (Cohen
et al., 1982; Fitz-Gibbon, 1977), tutoring is more effective on topics that involve quantitative skills than on nonquantitative topics, and tutoring is more
effective when it is highly integrated with the course curriculum than when
it is an extra activity. Second, we desired a sample of tutors that were reasonably
representative of the tutors in normal tutoring environments. Tutors are normally older students, paraprofessionals, and adult volunteers who have not been
extensively trained in tutoring techniques (Fitz-Gibbon, 1977). Third, we desired
a representative sample of college students rather than a restricted sample of
students who were having difficulties. Given that all students in the course participated in the tutoring sessions, there was a wide range of abilities and levels
of achievement within the college population.
115 
Graesser and Person
Examination scores were available for the undergraduate students, so we
could investigate the relationship between academic achievement in the course
and indices of student question asking. We could assess, for example, whether
more questions are asked by good students (who presumably self-regulate their
learning) or bad students (who have more knowledge deficits). We could assess
whether good students ask a higher proportion of high-quality questions, such
as deep-reasoning questions. As mentioned earlier, however, it was beyond the
scope of this study to investigate whether indices of student questioning and
tutor questioning have a causal impact on learning outcomes.
A second sample of tutoring sessions was collected to provide some assessment of the generality of the results from the first sample. The second sample
included seventh graders who were having problems with algebra. Specifically,
the sample included almost all of the tutoring sessions in algebra that were arranged at a local school during a one-month time span. Examination scores were
not available for these students, but we were able to examine the characteristics of the questions and to compare these characteristics with those of college
students. We selected this second sample because it also involved tutoring on
quantitative reasoning skills and because the students were old enough to be
verbally articulate.
Method
Sample 1: College Students Learning About Research Methods
Students and tutors. Tutoring protocols were collected from 27 undergraduate students at Memphis State University. The students were enrolled in an
upper division laboratory psychology course on research methods in the behavioral sciences. All students completed the tutoring sessions to fulfill a course
requirement (6% of the total points in the course). Therefore, we had tutoring
protocols on a representative sample of college students taking the class, as opposed to a restricted sample of students who were having difficulty with the
material.
Three psychology graduate students were selected as tutors. Each tutor
had received an A in an undergraduate research methodology course and a
graduate-level research methodology course. Each tutor had tutored students
on a few occasions prior to this study, but not in the area of research methods.
Therefore, the tutors had a modest amount of tutoring experience, but they
did not have extensive tutoring experience and did not receive training on the
tutoring process. As discussed earlier, these characteristics are representative
of the tutors that are available in most school systems; that is, typical tutors
have moderately high domain knowledge, a small or moderate amount of tutoring experience, and minimal training on the tutoring process. Each tutor was
paid $500 for serving as a tutor in 18 tutoring sessions. The tutors were not
teaching assistants for the course and were not research assistants in this study.
They also were not informed about the purpose of the research project and
the analyses that would be conducted.
116 
Question Asking During Tutoring
Learning materials. The course instructor selected six topics that were
normally troublesome for students in the course. Each topic had related subtopics that would be covered in the tutoring session. An index card was prepared
for each of the six topics; subtopics were listed with each topic, as specified
in the following.
* Variables: operational definitions, types of scales, values of variables
* Graphs: frequency distributions, plotting means, histograms
"* Statistics: decision matrix, Type I and II errors, t tests, probabilities
"* Hypothesis Testing: formulating a hypothesis, practical constraints, control groups, design, statistical analyses
"* Factorial Designs: independent variables, dependent variables, statistics,
main effects, cells, interactions
"* Interactions: independent variables, main effects, types of interactions,
statistical significance
Students were exposed to the material covered on a topic before they participated in a tutoring session. This was accomplished in two ways. First, each
topic was covered in a classroom lecture by the instructor before that topic
was covered in a tutoring session. Second, both the tutors and students were
required to read specific pages in the research methods text for the course (entitled Methods in Behavioral Research, Cozby, 1989) prior to the tutoring session. A mean of 14 pages was read prior to a tutoring session. Given that the
students already had substantial exposure to the tutoring topics, it is safe to
assume that they had an elementary to moderate amount of knowledge about
each topic.
The tutoring sessions spanned an 8-week period. The topics covered during the first 3 weeks were variables, graphs, and statistics, with one topic covered
per week. A 2-week break followed the first three tutoring sessions. The remaining three topics were covered during the subsequent 3 weeks.
Equipment and setting. The room used for the tutoring session was equipped with a videocamera, a television set, a marker board, colored markers, and
the Cozby textbook. The television screen was covered during the entire sessions. The camera was positioned so that the student and the entire marker
board was in sight. Therefore, the transcripts of the tutoring sessions included
both spoken utterances and messages on the marker board.
Procedure. Prior to the tutoring session, the students were told that they
would receive tutoring on particualr pages in the Cozby text. When a student
entered the tutoring room, the student was instructed to sit in view of the camera
and to read the topic card aloud. The topic card outlined the material in the
designated readings. The tutoring session subsequently proceeded in a natural
fashion, in whatever direction the tutor and student saw fit. The three tutors
were not given a specific format to follow, but they were told to resist the temptation of simply lecturing. The tutoring session lasted approximately 60 minutes,
ranging between 45 minutes (a minimum) and 80 minutes.
Each of the 27 students participated in two tutoring sessions. This permitted us to assess whether student questioning changed when the students had
117 
Graesser and Person
a small amount of exposure to the tutoring process (i.e., by comparing Session
1 with Session 2). A counterbalancing scheme was designed so that (a) a student never had the same tutor twice, (b) each tutor covered all six topics, (c)
each tutor was assigned to 18 tutoring sessions, and (d) a student was tutored
once during the first 3 weeks (i.e., three topics) and once during the last 3 weeks.
Therefore, each tutor had three students assigned to each of the six tutoring
topics, which yielded 54 sessions altogether. Ten of the 54 tutoring sessions
could not be transcribed because of audio problems or extreme video problems
that made it difficult to decipher messages on the marker board.
Examination scores. Achievement was measured by a total examination
score, based on three objective examinations during the course. There was a
total of 150 four-alternative, forced-choice questions in the total examination
score. Most of the items (67%) were selected by the instructor from an item
pool in an Instructor's Manual associated with the Cozby text. The other items
were prepared by the instructor of the course. All 150 items had been prepared
by the instructor before the semester in which the tutoring sessions were collected. The mean composite examination score of the 27 students was 100.6
(SD = 11.4). Given that the students answered 67% of the questions correctly
(100.6 + 150 = .67), the examination did not suffer from either a ceiling effect or floor effect. The tutors were not informed about the content and composition of the examinations.
Sample 2: Seventh Graders Learning About Algebra
Subjects and tutors. We collected 22 tutoring sessions at a local middle
school in Memphis. There were 13 seventh-grade students who were having
trouble with particular topics in their algebra class (according to the teachers).
The tutors were 10 high school students who normally provided these tutoring services for the middle school. On the average, a tutor had 9 hours of prior
tutoring experience before tutoring a student in this sample. The sample of tutoring sessions included almost all of the tutoring sessions on algebra that occurred
in the middle school for seventh graders during a one-month period. All of the
tutoring sessions were naturally occurring tutoring sessions at the middle school.
Unlike the college sample, the tutoring sessions in this sample were remedial
activities and were not course requirements.
Tutoring topics and sessions. Almost all of the tutoring sessions covered
three tutoring topics frequently problematic to seventh graders. These include:
(a) exponents, (b) constructing equations from algebra word problems, and (c)
fractions. A chapter or chapter section from a textbook was normally associated
with each topic. Tutors and students frequently referred to this material during the tutoring sessions. The tutoring sessions lasted approximately 60 minutes,
which was comparable to that of the research methods tutoring sessions. A
research assistant from Memphis State University videotaped the sessions in a
manner similar to the videotapings for the college sample.
Transcription and Coding of the Tutoring Sessions
Transcribers received a one-hour training session on how to transcribe the pro118 
Question Asking During Tutoring
tocols. They were instructed to transcribe the entire tutoring sessions verbatim,
including all "ums," "ahs," word fragments, broken sentences, and pauses. The
transcribers specified whether the tutor or the student spoke during each turn
of the exchange. The transcribers sketched any messages that had occurred on
the marker board in as much detail as possible. Hand gestures were specified
in parentheses whenever the student or tutor pointed to the marker board or
the book. Whenever the tutor and student spoke simultaneously, the parallel
speech streams were placed within brackets. Each written transcription was
verified for accuracy by a research assistant who spot-sampled random segments
in the session.
Six trained judges coded the questions in the transcripts on a number of
dimensions that were described in the Introduction. These judgments were
made in the context of the tutorial dialogue rather than speech acts in isolation. The judges were graduate and undergraduate research assistants.
Question identification. Two judges achieved a high reliability score in
deciding whether or not a speech act was a question, as defined in the Introduction (Cronbach's alpha = .96 or higher).
Degree of specification. Two judges categorized each question as to
whether it had a high, medium, or low degree of specification. They achieved
a spot-sample reliability score of .94.
Question-content category. Two judges were trained to classify the questions on the question-content categories in Table 1. For each question, the judges
independently decided which of the 18 categories best fit the question. If a
judge believed that a second or third category was also appropriate, the judge
specified the second or third category assignments. The judges achieved a spotsample reliability score of .96 or higher in deciding whether a particular category
would be assigned to a question. Approximately half of the questions were
assigned to only one question category (51%), whereas less than 1% of the
questions were hybrids of three content categories.
The question-category analysis permitted us to use either a monothetic or
a polythetic classification scheme. In the monothetic scheme, the categories
were mutually exclusive, so we had to formulate a set of priorities whenever
a question was a hybrid of two or more categories. There were two specific
rules for assigning priority. First, the verification, assertion, and request/directive categories had lower priority than the other 15 question categories. The
rationale for this priority rule is that the latter 15 categories were more specific
regarding the content of the information sought. Second, short-answer questions had lower priority than long-answer questions. The rationale for this rule
is that reasoning patterns are uncovered primarily in long-answer questions and
there was theoretical interest in uncovering questions that tap deep reasoning.
The most frequent hybrid by far was the amalgamation of a verification question with some other category. For example, the question "Is the mean of the
sample 4.5?" is a hybrid between a verification question and a quantification
question. Verification questions receive lower priority than the other content
categories, so this question would be assigned to the quantification category
in the monothetic analyses. In the polythetic scheme, each question could be
119 
Graesser and Person
assigned to one, two, or three question categories. The analyses reported in
the Results section focused exclusively on the monothetic classification scheme.
Question-generation mechanism. Two judges were trained to assign
questions to the four question-generation mechanisms described in the Introduction: knowledge deficit, common ground, social coordination, and conversational control. Each question could be assigned to one or two categories. Most
of the questions (72%) were assigned to only one category. The two judges
achieved a satisfactory reliability score (Cronbach's alpha = .81 or higher) when
deciding whether a mechanism was assigned to a question. In the case of hybrid
questions in monothetic analyses, the knowledge-deficit category had higher
priority than the other three categories because we were interested theoretically
in the extent to which the subjects took an active role in self-regulating their
knowledge. Also, the common-ground category had higher priority than the
social-coordination and conversational-control categories (which were comparatively low in frequencies).
Results
This section begins by reporting the overall number of questions asked by
students and tutors in the tutorial sessions. The frequencies of these questions
during tutoring were contrasted with those in classroom studies. The qualitative
characteristics of questions were subsequently examined by analyzing the questions on three dimensions: question category, question-generation mechanism,
and degree of specification. In all analyses, results from the two samples of tutoring sessions were compared (i.e., the Research Methods sample versus the
Algebra sample). Finally, achievement scores of students in the Research Methods
sample were correlated with frequencies of student questions and qualitative
characteristics of student questions.
The student-tutor dyad (i.e., single tutoring session) was treated as the unit
of analysis in all tests of statistical significance. Therefore, Tutor A with Student X was regarded as a separate case than Tutor B with Student X; similarly,
Tutor A with Student X was regarded as a separate case than Tutor A with Student Y. By treating the dyad (or tutoring session) as the unit of analysis, we
assume that the unique conversational patterns between a particular tutor and
student are more fundamental than consistent patterns of a tutor across different
students, and consistent patterns of a student across tutors. There is some
precedence in treating the dyad as the functional unit of analysis in conversation research (Kenny, 1990) because speech participants mutually constrain each
other in conversation. Statistical tests involved a between-group variable rather
than a repeated-measures variable in all comparisons between tutors and
students.
Overall Number of Student and Tutor Questions
The mean number of student questions per tutoring session in the Research
Methods sample was 21.1 (SD = 13.0), whereas the mean in the Algebra sample was 32.2 (SD = 19.7). These means were compared to the number of stu120 
Question Asking During Tutoring
dent questions in classroom settings, which have been extensively documented
in the literature. As discussed in the Introduction, the collective number of student questions in a classroom (per hour, approximately) ranged from 1.3 to
4.0, with a median of 3.0. The mean number of student questions in the tutoring sessions (which also lasted approximately one hour) exceeded the upper
bound of 4.0 student questions in the classroom t(43) = 8.74, p < .05,
Se = 1.96 in the Research Methods sample; t(21) = 6.91, p < .05, Se = 4.09
in the Algebra sample. These data support the general conclusion that student
questions are more prevalent in a tutoring environment than in a classroom.
The 3.0 estimate of student questions in a classroom consists of the total
number of questions asked by all of the students in a classroom. Given that
an average classroom has approximately 26.7 students (Dillon, 1988), the mean
number of questions asked by a particular student is only .11 question per hour.
We verified this rate by tape-recording 12 hours of classroom lectures in the
research methods course, focusing on those hours that covered the same topics
as the tutoring sessions in the Research Methods sample. The rate of student
questions was .17 question per student in the classroom, which compares
favorably with the .11 estimate from the literature. Given that a particular student asked an average of 26.5 questions per hour in the tutoring sessions in
the two samples of this study, and given that the classroom questioning literature
estimates that a particular student asks .11 question per hour in a classroom
setting, the incidence of student questions during tutoring is approximately 241
times the incidence of student questions in classroom settings (from the perspective of a single student).
The mean numbers of tutor questions per hour were 95.2 in the Research
Methods sample (SD = 60.9) and 112.1 in the Algebra sample (SD = 51.7) These
rates are significantly higher than the 69 question estimate of teacher questions
in classrooms, t(43) = 2.85, p < .05, Se = 9.2 for the Research Methods sample and t(21) = 3.91, p < .05, Se = 11.0 for the Algebra sample. It follows that
the incidence of tutor questions in the tutoring environment is 1.5 times the
incidence of teacher questions in a classroom.
According to the previously mentioned data, tutor questions are much more
prevalent than student questions in the tutoring sessions, just as teacher questions are more prevalent than student questions in the classroom. The differences
between tutor and student questions were significant in both the Research
Methods sample, F(1, 86) = 62.28, p < .05, MSe = 1936.9, and in the Algebra
sample, F(1, 42) = 46.13, p < .05, MSe = 1520.8. The frequency scores indicate that 80% of questions in a tutoring session are asked by the tutor (82%
in the Research Methods sample and 78% in the Algebra sample). This percentage is somewhat lower than the percentage of teacher questions in a classroom,
which is estimated at 96% (i.e., 69 - 72).
The finding that student questions are more prevalent in one-to-one tutoring than in classroom settings should be moderately encouraging to educators
who seek educational environments that promote active learning. Students apparently have more opportunity to self-regulate their learning in tutoring environments by asking more questions. According to the active injury hypothesis,
121 
Graesser and Person
the increase in student question asking may explain why learning is better in
tutoring environments than in classrooms. According to alternative hypotheses,
however, it is important to consider the quality of questions and the quality
of pedagogical activities. Subsequent analyses examined the quality of the questions generated by students and tutors.
Question-Content Categories
The questions in the two samples were segregated into the 18 question-content
categories (see in Table 1). There were 5,117 questions in the Research Methods
sample and 3,174 questions in the Algebra sample, so the question corpus was
quite large. Table 2 presents the breakdown of tutor questions and student questions in each sample. We adopted a monothetic classification scheme so the
proportion scores in each column add to 1.00 (except for round-off error). A
polythetic classification is not reported because it did not add to or alter any
of the conclusions that will be made on the basis of the monothetic classification.
The distributions of proportion scores among the 18 question categories
were quite similar for the two samples of tutoring sessions. We performed correlations on the proportion scores presented in Table 2. There was a high and
significant correlation between the set of proportions of tutor questions in the
Research Sample and that of the Algebra sample, r = .95, p < .05; the comparable correlation was also high and significant for student questions, r = .61,
p < .05.
Verification questions were the most prevalent questions for tutors (.45).
There were moderately high proportion scores for concept completion questions (. 10), quantification questions (.09), and instrumental-procedural questions
(.09) in the case of tutors. It should be noted that short answers are appropriate
for most of these question categories. In the case of students, the order of the
top four categories was verification (.22), instrumental-procedural (.21), concept completion (. 11), and quantification (. 11). Therefore, the same four categories emerged as being most frequent for both tutors and students.
The question distributions indicated that tutors asked a higher proportion
of short-answer questions than did students. As designated in Tables 1 and 2,
short-answer questions are segregated from long-answer questions; the assertion and request/directive categories are not included because they are ambiguous with respect to answer length. Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) were
performed on proportion scores in a factorial design that contrasted length of
expected answer (short-versus long-answer question categories) and speech participant (student versus tutor). In the Research Methods sample, short-answer
questions were more prevalent than long-answer questions, .56 versus .38,
respectively, F(1, 84) = 12.94, p < .05, MSe = .06, but there was no significant length x speech participant interaction. The difference between short- and
long-answer questions appears to be more pronounced for tutors (.60 versus
.35) than for students (.52 versus .40), but there was no significant interaction.
In the Algebra sample, once again the short-answer questions were more
prevalent than long-answer questions, .60 versus .38, respectively, F(1, 42) =
3.47, p < .05, MSe = .03, but there was a length x speech participant interac122

tion, F(1, 42) = 14.41, p < .05, MSe = .03. The difference between short- and
long-answer questions was not significant for students (.46 versus .49) whereas
it was robust for tutors (.73 versus .26). The tutors tended to place minimal
demands on the student because the tutors asked comparatively few questions
that require long-winded answers (compared to the questions asked by students).
In contrast, students either encouraged or permitted the tutor to talk because
they asked a comparatively high proportion of long-answer questions. The students perhaps attempted to place the burden on the tutor to articulate difficult
material and to trace the steps of reasoning.
Proportion scores were examined for the deep-reasoning questions, that
is, why, why not, how, what if. These question categories include antecedent,
consequence, goal-orientation, enablement, instrumental-procedural, and expectational questions. These proportion scores were significantly higher for
students than for tutors in the Research Methods sample, .22 and .16, respectively, F(1, 84) = 5.58, p < .05, MSe = .02, and in the Algebra sample, .39 versus .17, F(1, 42) = 20.69, p < .05, MSe = .02. Once again, the tutors were
comparatively reluctant to ask these deep-reasoning questions and thereby impose demands on students (compared to the questions asked by students).
Viewed differently, the students were more likely to select questions that expose the tutor's reasoning and problem solving.
Question-Generation Mechanisms
The questions were segregated into the four question-generation mechanisms
that were defined in the Introduction: knowledge deficit, common ground,
social coordination, and conversational control. Proportion scores are presented
in Table 3 for the two samples of tutoring sessions.
The two samples of tutoring sessions showed similar patterns of proportion scores. We performed an ANOVA on proportion scores as a function of
speech participants (tutor versus student) and two question-generation
mechanisms (knowledge deficit versus common ground). The interaction terms
were statistically significant in both samples, F(1, 86) = 134.14, p < .05,
MSe = .02 for Research Methods and F(1, 42) = 45.34, p < .05, MSe = .03 for
Algebra. The proportion scores for knowledge-deficit questions were higher

for students than for tutors in the Research Methods sample, F(1, 86) = 166.93,
p < .05, MSe = .01, and in the Algebra sample, F(1, 42) = 53.55, p < .05, MSe
= .01. In contrast, proportion scores for common-ground questions were lower
for students than for tutors in the Research Methods sample, F(1, 86) = 86.91,
p < .05, MSe = .01, and in the Algebra sample, F(1, 42) = 35.24, p < .05, MSe
= .02. The other two question-generation mechanisms were comparatively rare,
so statistical analyses are not reported.
It is informative that 29% of the student questions were attempts to correct knowledge deficits. It suggests that students somewhat take an active role
in self-regulating their learning. Most of the knowledge-deficit questions (.23 +
.29 = 79%) were triggered by contradictions or by anomalous facts/events the
students had trouble explaining. Another 17% of the knowledge-deficit questions were triggered by an obvious gap in the student's knowledge base; for
example, the tutor mentions the term antagonistic interaction and then the
student asks "So what is an antagonistic interaction?"
Most of the tutor questions and student questions monitored the common
ground between the speech participants. Not surprisingly, most of the efforts
of both parties were devoted to identifying, diagnosing, and verifying the
knowledge of the student, as opposed to the tutor. Most of the students'
common-ground questions (89%) were attempts to confirm the validity of their
own beliefs (e.g., "Doesn't a factorial design have two independent variables?");
only 4% of the tutors' common-ground questions were attempts to confirm
tutors' knowledge. The vast majority of the tutors' common-ground questions
(82 %) were assessments of the students' knowledge (e.g., "Do you know what
a factorial design is?", "Do you understand?"); only 3% of the students'
common-ground questions were assessments of the tutors' knowledge. As expected, therefore, there was an asymmetry in knowledge tracking because the
primary focus was on the knowledge base of the student. The tutor presumably
was viewed by both parties as having a good command of the material.
Degree of Question Specification
The questions were classified on degree of specification, with values of high,
medium, and low. Table 4 presents proportion scores, segregating tutor and
student questions in the two samples. The data from the two samples were
strikingly similar. A very small proportion (.02) of the questions had a high degree
of specification. The proportion scores for high-specification questions were
not significantly different for tutors and students in the two samples. In the
case of low-specification questions, however, the proportion scores were higher
for tutors than students in the Research Methods sample, F(1, 86) = 6.00,
p < .05, MSe = .03, and in the Algebra sample, F(1, 42) = 5.36, p < .05, MSe
= .03. There is a plausible explanation for the comparatively high proportion
of low-specification questions for tutors. They frequently attempted to gauge
whether the student was understanding the material by asking questions such
as "Do you understand?" or "Are you following?"; 35% of the tutors' questions were general comprehension-gauging questions, all of which are lowspecification questions.

Correlations Between Student Questions and Examination Scores
If good students are inquisitive, then we would expect a positive correlation
between examination scores and number of questions. On the other hand, good
students have fewer knowledge deficits, which would yield a negative relationship between examination scores and number of questions. We performed some
correlation analyses on the Research Methods sample because examination
scores were available. Separate correlations were computed for the first half
of the tutoring sessions and the second half. Each student had been assigned
to one tutoring session during the first half (i.e., consisting of 3 weeks, covering three tutoring topics) and to one tutoring session during the second half.
Table 5 presents correlations between examination scores and measures
of student question asking. The correlation between examination scores and
overal number of student questions was significantly negative during the first
half of the course, but not during the second half. Therefore, students with
more knowledge deficits (i.e., lower examination scores) asked more questions
in the first half of the course, but the trend did not persist in the second half.
Perhaps the good students learned to ask more questions after they had some
exposure to tutoring: This would explain the low, nonsignificant correlation
in the second half of the course. The low correlation might be explained by
a U-shaped function, such that both poor students and good students ask more
questions than students with an intermediate level of achievement. However,
a curvilinear relationship was not found to be statistically significant in any
analysis in this study that examined the relationship between student questioning
and examination scores (including all of the measures in Table 5).
We computed follow-up correlation analyses to assess whether good
students tended to ask more questions that involved deep reasoning or
knowledge deficits. Proportion scores were computed by dividing the frequency
of deep-reasoning questions (or alternatively, knowledge-deficit questions) by
the total number of student questions. We would expect a significant positive
correlation between the students' examination scores and the proportion of
deep-reasoning questions (or knowledge-deficit questions). As shown in Table

5, this prediction was confirmed in the second half of the course but not the
first half. In the second half, there was a significant positive correlation between
examination scores and (a) the proportion of questions that involved deep reasoning and (b) the proportion of questions that involved knowledge deficits;
in the first half, these two correlations were not statistically significant. These
data are consistent with the claim that the question-asking skills of good students
are enhanced after some exposure to tutoring. Unfortunately, the tutoring topics
were different in the first and second halves of the course, so we are uncertain
whether the differences mentioned previously between the first and second
halves can be attributed to exposure to tutoring or to variations among tutoring topics.
We have assumed that deep-reasoning questions including question-content
categories 11-16 In Table 2 (e.g., why, why not, how, and what if questions).
Such questions tap the steps and rationale in logical reasoning, in problemsolving procedures, in plans, and in causal sequences. We performed an addition analysis on the student questions to assess the validity of the claim that
these question categories are truly deeper questions than the other question
categories. Specifically, two research assistants classified each question on depth
by adopting Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives in the cognitive domain (Bloom, 1956). There were five values on this scale, as specified as follows.
1. This lowest level of depth includes knowledge of specific terminology
and specific facts (level 1.00 in Bloom's taxonomy). It includes student
questions that repeat tutor questions, questions that seek clarification
of the tutor's speech acts, and various questions that the judges considered shallow.
2. These questions involved ways and means of dealing with specifics,
including knowledge of conventions, trends, classifications and categories, criteria, and methodology (Level 1.20 in Bloom's taxnomy).
127 
Graesser and Person
3. These questions address knowledge of universals and abstractions in
a field, including principles, generalizations, theories, and structures
(Level 1.30 in Bloom's taxonomy).
4. These questions involve comprehension of the material to the extent
the student can perform translations, interpretations, and extrapolations
(Level 2.00 in Bloom's taxonomy).
5. These questions involve all of the deeper levels in Bloom's taxonomy
(Levels 3.00 through 6.00): Application, analysis, synthesis, and
evaluation.
The two judges could reliably classify the student questions on Bloom's taxonomy (Cronbach's alpha = .85).
Analyses revealed that the vast majority of student questions were at the
low (shallow) end of Bloom's taxonomy. The distribution of questions among
the five ratings was .70, .19, .04, .06, and .01 for ratings 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. These data clearly indicate that student questions are rarely deep.
We conducted an analysis that assessed whether deep-reasoning questions
were deep questions according to Bloom's taxonomy. For each student, we
computed the proportion of student questions that were regarded as comparatively deep in Bloom's taxonomy (i.e., ratings of 2, 3, 4, or 5). We found
that these proportions were highly correlated with the proportion of student
questions that were deep-reasoning questions, r = .64, p < .05. In contrast,
the proportion of questions that were deep in Bloom's taxonomy was not significantly correlated with the proportion of knowledge-deficit questions (r =
.24) and common-ground questions (r = - .11). Therefore, there is some validity to our claim that the deep-reasoning questions are truly deep questions.
Moreover, according to Table 5, there was a positive correlation between student achievement and deep questions in Bloom's taxonomy: This trend occurred in the second half of the course but not in the first half, just as we found
for deep-reasoning questions and knowledge-deficit questions.
Discussion
The first objective of this study was to document the number of questions asked
in one-to-one tutoring sessions and to compare these estimates to the questions
in classroom studies. We found that a student in a tutoring session asked approximately 240 times as many questions during a tutoring as a particular student would ask in a classroom study. Tutors asked about 1.5 times as many
questions as did teachers in a classroom setting. Therefore, tutoring clearly provides a setting for more active inquiry, particularly on the part of the student.
Our estimates of questions during tutoring were based on two radically different samples of students, namely a representative sample of college students
in a research methods class and a low-achieving sample of seventh graders attempting to learn algebra. The data were strikingly similar in these two samples
of students. The empirical estimates for classroom questioning were based on
studies that spanned several topics and countries (Buseri, 1988; Dillon, 1988;
Fenclova, 1978; Good et al., 1987; Nickel & Fenner, 1974; Susskind, 1969),
128

including classroom lectures in a research methods course that covered the same
material that was covered in the tutoring sessions of the college students.
We believe that our results are representative of tutoring in normal instructional settings, at least in the context of quantitative reasoning. However, more
research on tutoring is clearly needed before we can offer general claims about
tutoring that apply to diverse knowledge domains, age groups, educational programs, and so on. It is also possible that patterns of questioning will substantially vary as a function of the amount of tutoring experience that tutors and
students receive. Additional research is needed to identify the qualitative patterns of discourse interaction in tutorial dialogue (Graesser, in press).
The previously mentioned findings support the claim that tutoring provides a social, cognitive, and pedagogical context for students to take more control over their learning and to correct their idiosyncratic knowledge deficits.
Social barriers do not severely dampen inquisitiveness to the same extent as
they do in a classroom. The "active inquiry" hypothesis provides one potential explanation of the finding that learning is superior in tutoring settings than
in classroom environments (Bloom, 1984; Cohen et al., 1982). That is, students
may learn more in tutoring sessions because they have more opportunities to
ask questions that pertain to their knowledge deficits.
Computer software has recently been designed to permit extensive question asking by the learner; for example, a "Point and Query" (P&Q) system
radically facilitates the speed and quality of questioning (Graesser, Langston,
& Lang, 1992; Graesser, Langston, & Baggett, in press). The student learns entirely by asking questions and reading answers. To ask a question, the student
first points to a word or picture element on the computer screen and then to
a question that is relevant to the element (from a menu of relevant questions).
The menu of relevant questions is formulated on the basis of background
knowledge structures and a theory of human question answering called QUEST
(Graesser & Franklin, 1990; Graesser & Hemphill, 1991; Graesser, Lang, &
Roberts, 1991). The P&Q software is embedded in a hypertext system, so
answers are preformulated and quickly accessed; the student can ask a question with two points of a finger (or two clicks of a mouse). The P&Q software
is similar to some other menu-based question asking systems that have recently
been developed (Schank, Ferguson, Birnbaum, Barger, & Greising, 1991;
Sebrechts & Swartz, 1991).
Given that it is so easy to ask questions on these question-menu computer
systems, one might inquire about the incidence of learner questions on these
systems. Graesser, Langston, and Baggett (in press) collected data from college
students who learned about woodwind instruments with the P&Q software.
The goals of the learner were manipulated so that students were expected to
acquire deep causal knowledge in one condition and superficial knowledge in
another condition. The incidence of questioning was quite similar under these
two conditions. Students asked approximately 135 questions per hour. Therefore, a student asks .11 question per hour in a classroom, 26.5 questions per
hour in a tutoring setting with a human tutor, and 135 questions per hour in
a computerized learning environment in which the only way to learn is to ask
129 
Graesser and Person
questions. Students are clearly capable of engaging in active inquiry (as manifested by question asking), but the classroom environment does not foster it.
The reported tutoring data are consistent with the claim that students are
to some extent capable of self-regulating their learning by asking questions when
they spot knowledge deficits. We found that 29% of the students' questions
addressed some form of knowledge deficit about the domain knowledge they
were attempting to learn. These knowledge-deficit questions were triggered
when the student identified a contradiction, an anomalous fact or event, or a
word that was unfamiliar. Graesser and McMahen (1993) have also reported
that anomalous information causes an increase in the incidence of question asking in experiments that have precise control over the stimulus material. In that
study, subjects were instructed to generate questions while they solved different
versions of quantitative problems: complete original, deletion of critical information, addition of a contradictory statement, addition of an irrelevant statement. The transformed versions of the problems produced more questions than
did the original complete problem, and a subset of the questions addressed the
transformations. Therefore, there is evidence that students can to some extent
self-regulate their learning under both naturalistic tutoring environments and
more controlled laboratory environments. At the same time, it is important to
acknowledge that the students are not perfect in identifying their knowledge
deficits. Students frequently miss contradictions and inconsistencies in scientific text, mathematical word problems, and other types of material (Baker, 1979;
Glenberg, Wilkinson, & Epstein, 1982; Markman, 1979; Otero & Campanario,
1990).
Some additional findings are compatible with the claim that students have
at least a modest ability to self-regulate their learning. First, 89% of the students'
questions in the common-ground category were attempts to confirm that their
own knowledge was correct. In essence, they were asking "Is it true that a particular belief that I have is correct?" and were seeking verification from the
expert tutor. This indeed is an active monitoring of their own knowledge. Second, in the first half of the course there was a negative correlation between
the students' examination scores and the overall number of questions that they
asked. Thus, the students with more knowledge deficits ended up asking more
questions. Other researchers have reported negative correlations between
mastery of the material and the incidence of learner-questions in more restricted
experimental tasks (Fishbein, Eckart, Lauver, van Leeuwen, & Langmeyer, 1990;
Flammer, 1981). Third, there was some weak evidence that student achievement was positively correlated with the proportion of student questions that
are knowledge-deficit questions. This positive relationship is compatible with
the hypothesis that good students actively monitor their own comprehension
failures (Brown et al., 1983; Chi et al., 1989; Zimmerman, 1989). However, this
relationship was significant in the second half of the course, but not the first
half. The good students apparently need some exposure to tutoring before they
become sensitive to their knowledge deficits and ask questions that address
these deficits. Unfortunately, the tutoring topics were different in the two halves
of the course, so differences between the two halves could be attributed to
130 
Question Asking During Tutoring
fluctuations among tutoring topics rather than to exposure to tutoring. Clearly, additional research is needed to assess how patterns of student questioning
change as a function of tutoring experience.
The negative correlation between student achievement and overall number
of questions seems incompatible with the hypothesis that good students actively monitor their own comprehension failures. We believe that the apparent
contradiction can be resolved by considering the quality of the students' ability to self-regulate their knowledge and the quality of their questions. Specifically,
good comprehenders acquire the knowledge more thoroughly, at deeper, more
sophisticated levels; consequently, their questions are deeper, more sophisticated, and more focused on knowledge deficits. In contrast, the comparatively
poor students ask a large number of unsophisticated questions.
Our analyses of student questions revealed that a comparatively small percentage of their questions were deep, sophisticated questions that penetrated
the inherent complexity of the material. Whereas 92 % of the student questions
were at the shallow end of Bloom's educational objectives in the cognitive domain (namely level 1), only 8% spanned Levels 2 through 6. These results are
consistent with the conclusion that most students have not completely mastered
effective, sophisticated, question-asking skills.
Given that most students have not mastered effective question-asking skills,
then there should be benefits in learning after they are taught how to ask good
questions. In fact, there is substantial empirical evidence that there are robust
improvements in the comprehension, learning, and memory of technical material after students are trained how to ask good questions (Davey & McBride,
1986; Gavelek & Raphael, 1985; King, 1989, 1990; Palincsar & Brown, 1984;
Singer & Donlan, 1982). We should point out that the P&Q educational software has the potential to train students how to ask good questions. Students
would learn the good questions for any given domain of knowledge (e.g., science, mathematics, history, etc.) to the extent that the good questions are included on the question menu (and bad questions excluded). The QUEST model
currently specifies which categories of questions are good questions on the P&Q
software. We would not be surprised if the QUEST model proves to be inadequate in discriminating good from bad questions, but it does provide a first
step that is grounded both theoretically and empirically.
An important aspect of the tutoring process consists of monitoring the common ground between the tutor and student. Indeed, common ground is a pervasive problem in all forms of communication (Clark & Schaefer, 1989). The
identification, establishment, and modification of common ground is a collaborative process between speech participants (Carlsen, 1991; Fox, 1988; Graesser,
1993, in press; Resnick, Salmon, & Zeitz, 1991). As expected, most of the attention was centered on the student's knowledge in these tutoring sessions.
The majority of student questions were attempts to confirm his or her own
beliefs. The majority of tutor questions were attempts to identify what the student knows. Available research on the process of tutoring indicates that tutors
substantially vary in the extent to which they diagnose and repair a particular
student's knowledge deficits and conceptual bugs (McArthur et al., 1990; Put131 
Graesser and Person
nam, 1987). Some tutors grill students with a script of questions and with exercises that expose imperfect knowledge in a typical student (rather than a particular student). Other tutors are more sensitive to the idiosyncratic problems
of a particular student.
Graesser (in press) reported that tutors and students frequently enact a fivestep tutorial frame that establishes and updates common ground.
Step 1: Tutor question: The tutor asks the student a question to diagnose
the student's knoweldge about a subtopic, for example, "What is a factorial design?"
Step 2: Student answer: The student answers the tutor's question and
thereby displays his or her knowledge about the subtopic, for example,
"It has several variables."
Step 3: Answer evaluation: The tutor evaluates the quality of the student's answer, for example, "Well, not exactly."
Step 4: Answer elaboration: The answer is elaborated primarily by the
tutor (and to some extent by the student) to improve the quality of the
answer to the question, e.g., "A factorial design has at least two independent variables and one dependent variable."
Step 5: Assessment of student's understanding: The tutor assesses
whether the student understands the answer by asking a comprehensiongauging question, "Do you understand?"
The normative rules of polite conversation are sometimes incompatible
with the accurate establishment of common ground between tutor and student.
For example, 35% of the tutors' questions were open-ended questions that
gauged whether the student was understanding a topic being discussed (e.g.,
"Do you understand?" "Are you following?" "Okay?"). Students frequently
answer "Yes" when they fail to understand the material because they want to
be polite, because they want to avoid appearing ignorant, or because they are
unable to detect their lack of understanding. Tutors often accept this feedback,
assume the student has mastered the topic, and move on to another topic. Common ground is not accurately established when this occurs. In fact, Chi et al.
(1989) have reported that the comparatively poor students tended to answer
"Yes" to the question "Do you understand?" in tutoring sessions on physics;
the good students could identify their own knowledge deficits and answer "No."
Tutors and classroom teachers should be warned that it is inappropriate to trust
the feedback that students provide about their own knowledge.
The problem of monitoring common ground is complicated further by the
data on degree of question specification. Only 2 % of the questions of both tutors
and students had a high degree of specification. Half of the tutor questions (50%)
and 35 % of the student questions had a low degree of question specification.
As the degree of question specification decreases, the listener has a higher likelihood of being confused and there is an increase in problems in establishing
common ground. The context of the tutoring dialogue is frequently not sufficient to construct the intended meaning of a question when questions have
a low or medium degree of specification (Graesser, 1993). The prevalence of
132 
Question Asking During Tutoring
misunderstandings in dialogue has been documented in several contexts, including doctor-patient interactions, lawyer-witness interactions, and studentteacher interactions (Coombs & Alty, 1980; Edwards & Mercer, 1989; Labov
& Fanshel, 1977; Valdez, 1986). Tutors should be instructed to formulate their
questions with a higher degree of specification.
The tutors tended to ask short-answer questions that placed minimal
burdens on the students in supplying information. For tutors, 67% of the questions were short-answer questions, 31% were long-answer questions, and 3 %
were in question categories that had an ambiguous status with respect to length
of answer (i.e., assertions and requests/directives). In contrast, 49% of the student questions were short-answer questions and 45 % were long-answer questions. Similarly, the proportion scores for deep-reasoning questions were higher
for students than for tutors (.31 versus .17). Therefore, the students selected
a comparatively high proportion of questions that invited lengthy answers and
reasoning from the tutors, whereas tutors did not place comparable burdens
on the student. This tendency is incompatible with the pedagogical goal of encouraging students to expose their reasoning and to organize coherent messages.
Perhaps tutors should be instructed to ask more long-answer questions and more
deep-reasoning questions.
The most prevalent question-generation mechanisms were attempts to correct knowledge deficits and to monitor common ground. The other two types
of question-generation mechanisms were not very frequent because of the social
constraints of the tutorial context. Tutoring does not ordinarily involve physical
activities that span long time periods, so very few questions were attempts to
coordinate social activity. Social-coordination questions (i.e., indirect requests,
indirect advice, offers, permission, and negotiations) are more prevalent in contexts where there are several agents working together over a longer time span.
Conversational-control questions were also infrequent because there are only
two speech participants in a tutorial dialogue. Conversational-control questions
are more frequent when several individuals arer interacting socially and it is
important to distribute contributions among many individuals.
This study has documented the questions asked during tutorial sessions
and has discussed the relevance of question asking to theories of learning, cognition, and conversation. We have pointed out a few ways that tutors might improve their question-asking skills to facilitate student learning. Few studies have
examined the process of tutoring and the impact of these processes on learning outcomes. A productive direction for future research will be to examine
tutoring processes and strategies in greater detail and to determine which of
these processes explain why tutoring is an excellent method of learning.
